Here's a list of ideas and stuff that needs to be done regarding the localizations. Already done work is moved to the namesake section.

## To-Do

* Finish fixing the UT templates created by Buggie.
* Add (and fix) the U1 templates created by Buggie.
* Add the Guidelines in a comfortable, editable way.
* Devise a method to deal with the shared files like the Wiki does (separate Public headers and rest of the text, fuse the similar lines, etc...)
* Devise a method to generate the localization files from a template and ensure the files are coded into UTF-8 w/BOM. **IT SHOULD BE A MULTI-PLATFORM METHOD**.
* [Add another idea here]

## Already done

TBA.
