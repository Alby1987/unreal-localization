Message=Again we have someone, who has stolen Taridium. Over the past year that's nearly 1,320 thefts. Since the building of the base, this has been the only problem.
M_NewMessage=Krall notes
M_TransMessage=Krall notes

[TranslatorEvent2]
Message=This taridium theft must be committed by those Kralls and Skaarj. In our world we do not steal from each other. Over the years we managed to create a pretty decent system of government of the people.

Message=Madehiten is full of vegetation and for the past 400 years is inhabited by the Nali, who live here in peace. They appreciate this planet. Madehiten people are reportedly going to be sent to Naqadah mines.

Message=It's interesting that the enemy race came here so quickly after the expulsion of the regime. The would have no interest, if it weren't for the mining.

M_TransMessage=Krall notes

[TranslatorEvent7]
Message=I summoned all the punks and went to the base. But we had nothing, that could stand against the Krall. There's nothing to do, but wait for a miracle. At least Punk is not dead.

Message=One punker told me, a week ago crashed a ship. The name I think was Baltar. In the wreckage was the record of the escape pod, that crashed on Madehiten. The pilots were there long ago and became friends with the locals.

Message=15 Feb 2084 After a long absence we visited Madehiten. Sadly we found out, that we will not be able to help. They only have medieval weapons and most are decorations. Nali are a peaceful nation, like the Nox.

[TranslatorEvent10]
Message=A pal of mine once told me about a mysterious network of Stargates. One is here to use, but no-one knows how. To use it you must enter the 7 symbols. Sadly we've read almost the manual and nothing worked. Some know a few symbols, but it's not enough.

[TranslatorEvent17]
Message=Haros Communication: We got prisoners, then divided them to work in the mines at Madehiten and Sirius. On the way we lost several ships near Madehiten. The local residents would not be able to harm our vessels. There must be something worse.

[TranslatorEvent21]
Message=There is a screen for UNREAL 3, but it's stuck somehow and won't load. CTR + ALT + DELETE, and ... nothing. RESET not functioning. Nothing works. Perhaps I'll try hammer blows to the CPU...

[TranslatorEvent22]
Message=Finally it's rebooting... Windows is starting...... ERROR! A file is missing?  There's a very long list of missing files, then nothing. The screen goes black.

[TranslatorEvent27]

[TranslatorEvent33]
Message=My Log: Must be a gallery of local residents. I saw as I was reading the book. Tam wrote, that punk was once on Earth. Today, the government would not tolerate it. Apparently there were punks long before the war.

[TranslatorEvent38]
Message=My Log: Looks like a picture storage. I know almost nothing about the punks. Since I was born during the war when many were killed, I knew nothing about their ideas.

[TranslatorEvent39]
Message=My Log: I'm finally at the entrance. Now things get a lot tougher. I doubt they just let anyone in.
M_NewMessage=My Log

[TranslatorEvent40]
Message=My Log: An interesting mix of architecture. But why pyramids in the middle of the city? Is it for landing the spacecraft from the StarGate? I'm not going to wait to find out.
