Message="28.July 2084 - Finally I've managed to penetrate into the cargo area without them noticing. Tauri is a world full of hatred, envyness and evil. I won't stay there not even for one minute. The route of Baltar goes around a planet named Exploited. As soon as the ship gets close enough, I'll steal the escape pod and fly there. On this planet, people are living completely free without some fucking warfare-seeking leaders."
