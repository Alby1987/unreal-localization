Message=My Log: This room looks grimy. I better be careful here. I see that over there in the altar is a book, maybe I should look inside.

Message=Our planet Exploited was overran by the Krall and now they are transfering us somewhere else. The crew has some problems, I have heard gunfire. Something probably assaulted us.

Message=Stardate 25th July 2084. As usual we were transfering prisoners from planet Exploited. Only when we were near planet Madehiten, we have picked up a small shuttle. I have ordered to explore it, but it turned out to be a fatal mistake. It was full of Pupae. These creatures eat biological mass and are capable of eating out entire vegetation on planets. They are proliferating very quickly, there's just too many of them. Most of the crew is already dead. The Pupae could be only killed by destroying braking crystals and the entire ship would burn in the atmosphere.
