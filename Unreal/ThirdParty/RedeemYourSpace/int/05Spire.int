Message="Theorius: About 100 years ago the planet was very rich on the flora. Such a beautiful world we have never seen before. When we visited the planet a year ago, there was only barren wasteland. SoulStone: Years abandoned planet, we assume it was once inhabited by the Tau'ri people. Today only castle ruins and strange constructions from menhirs."

Message="Exploited: About 400 years ago it was a mountainous and green planet, but after an impact of asteroid most of the vegetation was destroyed. From there on the planet is rather volcanic. In the year 2025 it was inhabited by Tau'ri and chosen for Tarydium processing. In the year 2048 the factories started closing. In the year 2061 it was chosen for Naquadah processing, but the enslaved population rebelled and expelled the rulers out. Then the planet was renamed from Taros to Exploited after an 110 years old band."

Message="Mythorus: Very bleak world. Used to be full of vegetation. Nowadays completely parched. The only thing standing there is some sort of fort, in which is hidden a seed of life, which can bring life to dead worlds. During our visit we killed few bugs. We have made various tests on them and found out, that they eat everything they come across and are spreading very quickly."

Message="We have found these weapons in the ruins of the house near the gate. They were probably brought by strangers from another worlds. From where they really are, we don't know.
